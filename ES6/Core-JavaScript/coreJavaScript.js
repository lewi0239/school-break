What is Core JS?
ECMA is the standard that defines the capabilities of a programming language

JavaScript is the actual language which is the implemented version of ECMAScript

There are different JavaScript Engines that are used to interpret and run that JavaScript files. 
THe two most prevalent are V8 Chrome from Google an Webkit from Apple. The V8 Chrome engine is
used in Chrome, edge, Opera, Brave, and Nodejs, as well as a number of other smaller browsers

//To create variables in JavaScript there are three keywords that we can use

var old;
let name;
const PI = 3.14;

//The first two lines in this example we are declaring a variable. This is what the
// process of creating the storage space for the value and giving it a label is called.

//JavaScript programming languages will insist that you tell them what kind of info
//is going to be stored in the variable and will only let you use that one kind of of info
// in the variable after it is declared.
//JavaScript lerts you change the kind of infomraiton (DataType) at any point.
//There are two groups of Data Types in JavaScript: Primitive and objects.
// If your datatyep is not a primitive then its automatically an object.

//Primities are just a value:

//objects can have properties, methods, and valu es/events:

//The primitive types in JavaScript are:

/* 
1. String: a sequence of characters that are used to represent text.
2. Number: a numeric value
3. Boolean: a true or false value
4. Undefine a variable that has not been assigned a value
5. Null: a variable that has been assigned a value of null
6. Symbol: a unique value that's not equal to any other value
7. BigInt: a numeric value that can represent integers of arbitrary length

If a variable does not hold one of these things then it is automatically an object.

Functions are series of commands that get bundled together 
so that tehy can be run, in that order, onve or multiplke times

functions can be passed information when they are called on to run.
They can call other functions to maake them run. They can also return some type 
of resulting value when needed.

Functions nearly, all habve a name, just like variables, so you can references them when you need them to run

Functions have arguements and peramaters:

An argument is a value that is passded to a function. The goals for writing functions is to make them pure
This partly means that they should always returnb the same results if you give them the same input values
Those input values are the arguments 

By having arguments for our functions, we gain flexibility and reuse
Reuse menas writing less code

parameters are global variables that the function can acess, there are two kind of special sytntax: Default parameters
and rest parameters:

Rest:
The rest parameter syntax allows us to reperesent an indefinite number of arguments as an array

In the following example, the function multiply uses reset parameters to collect arguments from the second
one to the end. The function then multiplies these by the first arugment

Methods in JavaScript

Features: example based on Math.() static methods

Static Methods:	
Access = Belongs to the class itself
Usage = Called on the class, not on instances
State = Does not access instance properties or this
Common Use Case	= Utility or helper functions (e.g., Math.random())

Instance Methods:
Access = Belongs to the instance of the class
Usage = Called on an instance of the class
State = Accesses the instance's properties via this
Common Use Case =  Math.random())	Actions that depend on the instance's state

Constructor Methods:
The constructor method is a special type of instance method that is automatically called when a new instance of a class is created. It is used to initialize the objectâ€™s properties.

Prototype Methods:
Instance methods in JavaScript are often referred to as prototype methods, as they are defined on the prototype of a class (or constructor function). All instances of the class share the same prototype, meaning they share the same methods. If a method is defined in the prototype, all instances will have access to it.

Getter and Settor Methods:
Getters and setters are special methods in JavaScript that allow you to define custom behavior when accessing or assigning a property. These methods are useful for encapsulating private data or adding validation logic when interacting with object properties.

*/

/*
Variable Scope and Hoisting:
Scope is a term used to describe where a variable is visible (can be accessed from). With either 
let or const we have the same options for scope. A variable can be in the global scope or in block scope
A block scope is created whereever you write {}. Inside the curly braces and does not exist outside them.

Functions all (except some arrow functions) have a set of curly braces. So, functions all have their owb block
scope. There can be other control structures like if statements or loops that also create blocks. Each of these 
blocks is a new scope to declare variables.

Variables that are declared outside of any function are said to be in the global scope. They are visible anywhere in your code.

Hositing is an effect that happens to variables and functions in JavaScrip when the script is read for the 
first time by the JavaScript engine. When you run a script, it is actually being read twice. One to identify
all the functions and variables and determine their scope, and a sceond time to execute the code.

Variable declarations are idenftied with the first pass. The exitence of the variable is hoisted to the top
of their scope. They cant be used fro anywhere but the JavaScript engine is aware of their existence
When you get to the line that declares the variable the default undefined value is assigned to the variable

So, function expressions can be assigned to variables. The expressions itself does NOT get hoisted. The 
Variable name is what gets hoiste o the top of its scope.

2.2 Truthiness, Control Flow, Strings
If Statements
if statements are a common construct in most programming languages. Simply put, they are a way to let your program make decisions based on yes - no questions.

*/
if (a == 5) {
  //notice the two equal signs?
}

/* 
The example above shows a simple if statement. Inside the parentheses is where you put the question you want the program to ask. Everything and anything that you place inside the parentheses will be boiled down to a yes or no answer.

When asking questions in if statements, comparison operators are used between the values being compared. Greater than >, less than <, equal to ==, greater than or equal to >= and less than or equal to <=, are the comparison operators.

Sometimes you just want to know if something exists or has a value equivalent to true. (See Truthiness below). We can just put a single variable inside the parentheses to check this. We can also add an exclamaition mark in front of the variable to check for the opposite.


*/

let varX = 5;
if (varX) {
  //varx is a non-zero number and x is not null or undefinded
  // if read this "if x"
}

if (!varX) {
  //x is zero or undefined or null
  //we would this as "if not x"
}

/* 
Else and Else If
When you need to do things based on both the TRUE and FALSE conditions then you can use an if-else statement.

*/

let varY = 10;

if (varY >= 10) {
  console.log("Sometimes numbers can be larger than 10");
} else {
  console.log("hmm.. still smaller than 10");
}

/* 
Two vs Three equal signs
The examples up to this point have all been using two equal signs. This means that we are comparing the values of the two operands.

There is another comparison operator, three equal signs. It compares the two operands to see if they are actually the same object, not just the same value.

*/

let ran1 = 4;
let ran2 = "4";

console.log(ran1 === ran2); //not equal
console.log(ran1 == ran2); //equal

/* 
Ternary Statements
Ternary statements are used as a short-hand for if else statements. When you have an if clause AND and else clause and there is one command to run for each condition, then you can use a ternary operator.

These are often used to assign one of two possible values to a variable.

The basic syntax requires a ? and a :. The expression to the left of the question mark is the question you are asking. Between the question mark and the colon is the value to use or command to run if the question was truthy. The expression that comes after the colon is the value to use or command to run if the question was falsey.

let skyColor = "blue"
  ? "The sky has always been this way"
  : "Wait.. the sky isn't blue??";

/* 
 
 Switch Case Statements
If you had an if statement that was going to compare a variable to a finite list of possible values then a useful alternative to all those parentheses and curly braces might be a switch case statement.

Let's say that we have a variable called someName which contains a name. If the name is one of six possible values then we want to do something specific, tailored to that name. If it is not one of the six then we have a generic thing to do.

We use the keyword case to provide a comparison value for someName. Whatever commands that come after a matching case value will run until a break command is encountered.

You can have a list of possible matches written as a series of case statements written one after another with no break between them.

String Methods
As we already mentioned, Strings in JavaScript are a Primitive datatype.

However, JavaScript also has an Object of type String. When you create a variable and assign a string value to that variable, then JS will quietly create one of these String Objects in the background for you.

This allows us to use the length property and all the String methods like trim, indexOf, split, toUpperCase, toLowerCase, padStart and many others.


Javascript String Methods:
"Hello".charAt(4)             =>  o
"Hello".concat("", "world")   =>  Hello world
"Hello".startsWith("H")       =>  true
"Hello".endsWith("o")         =>  true
"Hello".includes("x")         =>  false
"Hello".indexOf("l")          =>  2
"Hello".lastIndexOf("l")      =>  3
"Hello".match(/[A-Z]/g)       =>  ['H']
"Hello".padStart(6, "?")      =>  ?Hello
"Hello".padEnd(6, "?")        =>  Hello?
"Hello".repeat(3)             =>  HelloHelloHello
"Hello".replace("llo", "y")   =>  Hey
"Hello".search("e")           =>  1
"Hello".slice(1, 3)           =>  el
"Hello".split('')             =>  ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
"Hello".substring(2, 4)       =>  ll
"Hello".toLowerCase()         =>  hello
"Hello".toUpperCase()         =>  HELLO

The Math Object:

All of these things can be accomplished with the Mathematical methods.

These methods all begin with the Math object name:

Math.round(num); //returns the next highest or lowest integer depending on its decimal value.
Math.floor(num); //always rounds down to the next lowest integer
Math.ceil(num); //always rounds up to the next highest integer
Math.random(); //returns a random value between 0 and 1.
Math.max(list, of, numbers); //returns the largest number from the list
Math.min(list, of, numbers); //returns the smallest number from the list
Math.abs(num); //returns the absolute value of the number
Math.sign(num); //returns 1, -1, 0, -0, NaN to tell you if the number is positive or negative
Math.sin(radians); //returns the sine value for the provided radian value
Math.cos(radians); //returns the value of Cosine for the provided radian value
Math.tan(radians); //returns the value of Tangent for the provided radian value
Math.PI; //Use this as if it were a variable holding the value of Pi

There is a new Temporal object that is under development. It will give us a lot more control over things like time zones, time ranges, and international formatting. Until that happens, we still have a basic Date object that we can use for all our basic needs.
