What is Core JS?
ECMA is the standard that defines the capabilities of a programming language

JavaScript is the actual language which is the implemented version of ECMAScript

There are different JavaScript Engines that are used to interpret and run that JavaScript files. 
THe two most prevalent are V8 Chrome from Google an Webkit from Apple. The V8 Chrome engine is
used in Chrome, edge, Opera, Brave, and Nodejs, as well as a number of other smaller browsers

//To create variables in JavaScript there are three keywords that we can use

var old;
let name;
const PI = 3.14;

//The first two lines in this example we are declaring a variable. This is what the
// process of creating the storage space for the value and giving it a label is called.

//JavaScript programming languages will insist that you tell them what kind of info
//is going to be stored in the variable and will only let you use that one kind of of info
// in the variable after it is declared.
//JavaScript lerts you change the kind of infomraiton (DataType) at any point.
//There are two groups of Data Types in JavaScript: Primitive and objects.
// If your datatyep is not a primitive then its automatically an object.

//Primities are just a value:

//objects can have properties, methods, and valu es/events:

//The primitive types in JavaScript are:

/* 
1. String: a sequence of characters that are used to represent text.
2. Number: a numeric value
3. Boolean: a true or false value
4. Undefine a variable that has not been assigned a value
5. Null: a variable that has been assigned a value of null
6. Symbol: a unique value that's not equal to any other value
7. BigInt: a numeric value that can represent integers of arbitrary length

If a variable does not hold one of these things then it is automatically an object.

/* 
Functions are series of commands that get bundled together 
so that tehy can be run, in that order, onve or multiplke times

functions can be passed information when they are called on to run.
They can call other functions to maake them run. They can also return some type 
of resulting value when needed.

Functions nearly, all habve a name, just like variables, so you can references them when you need them to run

Functions have arguements and peramaters:

An argument is a value that is passded to a function. The goals for writing functions is to make them pure
This partly means that they should always returnb the same results if you give them the same input values
Those input values are the arguments 

By having arguments for our functions, we gain flexibility and reuse
Reuse menas writing less code

parameters are global variables that the function can acess, there are two kind of special sytntax: Default parameters
and rest parameters:

Rest:
The rest parameter syntax allows us to reperesent an indefinite number of arguments as an array

In the following example, the function multiply uses reset parameters to collect arguments from the second
one to the end. The function then multiplies these by the first arugment

Methods in JavaScript

Features: example based on Math.() static methods

Static Methods:	
Access = Belongs to the class itself
Usage = Called on the class, not on instances
State = Does not access instance properties or this
Common Use Case	= Utility or helper functions (e.g., Math.random())

Instance Methods:
Access = Belongs to the instance of the class
Usage = Called on an instance of the class
State = Accesses the instance's properties via this
Common Use Case =  Math.random())	Actions that depend on the instance's state

Constructor Methods:
The constructor method is a special type of instance method that is automatically called when a new instance of a class is created. It is used to initialize the objectâ€™s properties.

Prototype Methods:
Instance methods in JavaScript are often referred to as prototype methods, as they are defined on the prototype of a class (or constructor function). All instances of the class share the same prototype, meaning they share the same methods. If a method is defined in the prototype, all instances will have access to it.

Getter and Settor Methods:
Getters and setters are special methods in JavaScript that allow you to define custom behavior when accessing or assigning a property. These methods are useful for encapsulating private data or adding validation logic when interacting with object properties.

*/

/*
Variable Scope and Hoisting:
Scope is a term used to describe where a variable is visible (can be accessed from). With either 
let or const we have the same options for scope. A variable can be in the global scope or in block scope
A block scope is created whereever you write {}. Inside the curly braces and does not exist outside them.

Functions all (except some arrow functions) have a set of curly braces. So, functions all have their owb block
scope. There can be other control structures like if statements or loops that also create blocks. Each of these 
blocks is a new scope to declare variables.

Variables that are declared outside of any function are said to be in the global scope. They are visible anywhere in your code.

Hositing is an effect that happens to variables and functions in JavaScrip when the script is read for the 
first time by the JavaScript engine. When you run a script, it is actually being read twice. One to identify
all the functions and variables and determine their scope, and a sceond time to execute the code.

Variable declarations are idenftied with the first pass. The exitence of the variable is hoisted to the top
of their scope. They cant be used fro anywhere but the JavaScript engine is aware of their existence
When you get to the line that declares the variable the default undefined value is assigned to the variable

So, function expressions can be assigned to variables. The expressions itself does NOT get hoisted. The 
Variable name is what gets hoiste o the top of its scope.

2.2 Truthiness, Control Flow, Strings
If Statements
if statements are a common construct in most programming languages. Simply put, they are a way to let your program make decisions based on yes - no questions.

*/
if (a == 5) {
  //notice the two equal signs?
}

/* 
The example above shows a simple if statement. Inside the parentheses is where you put the question you want the program to ask. Everything and anything that you place inside the parentheses will be boiled down to a yes or no answer.

When asking questions in if statements, comparison operators are used between the values being compared. Greater than >, less than <, equal to ==, greater than or equal to >= and less than or equal to <=, are the comparison operators.

Sometimes you just want to know if something exists or has a value equivalent to true. (See Truthiness below). We can just put a single variable inside the parentheses to check this. We can also add an exclamaition mark in front of the variable to check for the opposite.


*/

let varX = 5;
if (varX) {
  //varx is a non-zero number and x is not null or undefinded
  // if read this "if x"
}

if (!varX) {
  //x is zero or undefined or null
  //we would this as "if not x"
}

/* 
Else and Else If
When you need to do things based on both the TRUE and FALSE conditions then you can use an if-else statement.

*/

let varY = 10;

if (varY >= 10) {
  console.log("Sometimes numbers can be larger than 10");
} else {
  console.log("hmm.. still smaller than 10");
}

/* 
Two vs Three equal signs
The examples up to this point have all been using two equal signs. This means that we are comparing the values of the two operands.

There is another comparison operator, three equal signs. It compares the two operands to see if they are actually the same object, not just the same value.

*/

let ran1 = 4;
let ran2 = "4";

console.log(ran1 === ran2); //not equal
console.log(ran1 == ran2); //equal

/* 
Ternary Statements
Ternary statements are used as a short-hand for if else statements. When you have an if clause AND and else clause and there is one command to run for each condition, then you can use a ternary operator.

These are often used to assign one of two possible values to a variable.

The basic syntax requires a ? and a :. The expression to the left of the question mark is the question you are asking. Between the question mark and the colon is the value to use or command to run if the question was truthy. The expression that comes after the colon is the value to use or command to run if the question was falsey.

let skyColor = "blue"
  ? "The sky has always been this way"
  : "Wait.. the sky isn't blue??";

/* 
 
 Switch Case Statements
If you had an if statement that was going to compare a variable to a finite list of possible values then a useful alternative to all those parentheses and curly braces might be a switch case statement.

Let's say that we have a variable called someName which contains a name. If the name is one of six possible values then we want to do something specific, tailored to that name. If it is not one of the six then we have a generic thing to do.

We use the keyword case to provide a comparison value for someName. Whatever commands that come after a matching case value will run until a break command is encountered.

You can have a list of possible matches written as a series of case statements written one after another with no break between them.

String Methods
As we already mentioned, Strings in JavaScript are a Primitive datatype.

However, JavaScript also has an Object of type String. When you create a variable and assign a string value to that variable, then JS will quietly create one of these String Objects in the background for you.

This allows us to use the length property and all the String methods like trim, indexOf, split, toUpperCase, toLowerCase, padStart and many others.


Javascript String Methods:
"Hello".charAt(4)             =>  o
"Hello".concat("", "world")   =>  Hello world
"Hello".startsWith("H")       =>  true
"Hello".endsWith("o")         =>  true
"Hello".includes("x")         =>  false
"Hello".indexOf("l")          =>  2
"Hello".lastIndexOf("l")      =>  3

The Math Object:

All of these things can be accomplished with the Mathematical methods.

These methods all begin with the Math object name:

Math.round(num); //returns the next highest or lowest integer depending on its decimal value.
Math.floor(num); //always rounds down to the next lowest integer
Math.ceil(num); //always rounds up to the next highest integer
Math.random(); //returns a random value between 0 and 1.
Math.max(list, of, numbers); //returns the largest number from the list
Math.min(list, of, numbers); //returns the smallest number from the list
Math.abs(num); //returns the absolute value of the number
Math.sign(num); //returns 1, -1, 0, -0, NaN to tell you if the number is positive or negative
Math.sin(radians); //returns the sine value for the provided radian value
Math.cos(radians); //returns the value of Cosine for the provided radian value
Math.tan(radians); //returns the value of Tangent for the provided radian value

There is a new Temporal object that is under development. It will give us a lot more control over things like time zones, time ranges, and international formatting. Until that happens, we still have a basic Date object that we can use for all our basic needs.

/* 
loops, for in loop, for of loop, while loop, infinite loops, do while loop, and for loops

Loops
A loop is a very common programming structure. It is actually part of the control-flow category that we discussed last week.

The purpose of a loop is to repeat one or more commands, as quickly as possible, a specific number of times or until a condition is met.

First, lets review why we have loops. They are a common feature in programming languages. Say, for example, that you wanted to create a list of five random numbers. You could declare five variables and use the Math.random( ) method to generate the numbers and assign them to the variables. We could do this with just repeating the same line of code five times.

for (initializer; condition; iterator) {
   Code to be executed in each iteration
}



The example above is the standard for loop. The code inside the parentheses is split into three parts. The three parts are divided by semi-colons. ;

Initialization. Declare local variables for the loop. Usually just a variable that can be used to count the number of iterations of the loop. Commonly known as the counter variable. This part runs before any looping begins. You can declare as many variables as you want here, separating each declaration with a comma.
Test condition. Normally this means comparing your counter variable to a maximum or minimum value. The loop will run this test once before each iteration of the loop.
Increment/Decrement. Every time the loop finishes running the commands that are inside the curly braces, this part of the code runs. It runs after the commands and before the next test.

*/

let nums = [];

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(nums.push(Math.random));
}

/* 
For in Loop
A second type of for loop is the for...in loop. These are used to loop through a list of items that have a known number of items. They work with Objects that are iterable. We will talk more about this in the future. For now, just think of it as a short hand way to loop through an Array.


*/
let myArray = [100, 200, 300];

for (let prop in myArray) {
  console.log(myArray[prop]);
}

/* 

There is a difference between for...in and for...of is that for...of cannot loop over most Objects. This has to do with the difference between Iterable and Enumerable


*/

/* 
While Loop
There are two kinds of while loops in JavaScript, the while loop and the do..while loop. The difference between them is that the do..while loop will always run at least once because it runs the loop before checking to see if the while test passes. The while loop will test your condition before it runs the loop.

*/

var counter = 0;
while (counter < 10) {
  console.log(counter);
  counter++;
}

var counter2 = 0;
do {
  console.log(counter2);
  counter2++;
} while (counter2 < 10);

/* 
Infinite Loops
When using while loops you do need to be careful that you don't create an infinite loop condition. That is a loop that never ends. When this happens your code can quickly use up all the system resources and even make the browser crash.

While modern browsers are pretty good at avoiding the crash part, it will still result in your code ceasing to run.

Consider the code example below. That loop will never end. The value of isRunning will always be true.

let i = 0;
let isRunning = true;

while (isRunning) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}

while (isRunning) {
  console.log(i); //output the value of i
  i++; //increment the value of i
  if (i > 100) {
    isRunning = false;
  }
}

Do While loop
There is one other variant of the while loop called do while.


*/

let i01 = 100;

do {
  console.log(i01); //output the value of i
  i01++; //increment the value of i
} while (i01 < 100);

/* 
JavaScript Array Objects
Arrays in JavaScript are simply numbered lists. A list of names, dates, numbers, or anything really. To create an Array we can use either the Array constructor function or write an Array literal.

Arrays in JS are dynamically built and sized, meaning that you can change the number of elements inside one at any time. You do not have to provide a size limit when you create one.

To determine the number of items in an Array, use the length property.



Destructive Array Methods:
These methods modify the original array:

.push() â€“ Adds one or more elements to the end of an array.
.pop() â€“ Removes the last element from an array.
.shift() â€“ Removes the first element from an array.
.unshift() â€“ Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array.
.splice() â€“ Adds or removes elements at a specified index.
.reverse() â€“ Reverses the order of elements in an array.
.sort() â€“ Sorts the elements of an array in place.

Non-Destructive Array Methods:
These methods do not change the original array; they return a new array or a value:

.concat() â€“ Combines two or more arrays and returns a new array.
.slice() â€“ Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.
.map() â€“ Creates a new array with the results of calling a function on every element.
.filter() â€“ Creates a new array with all elements that pass a test.
.reduce() â€“ Applies a function against an accumulator and each element to reduce it to a single value.
.find() â€“ Returns the first element that satisfies a provided condition.
.includes() â€“ Checks if an array includes a certain value.
.indexOf() â€“ Returns the first index at which a given element can be found.
.forEach() â€“ Executes a function on each element (doesn't modify the array, but doesn't return a new array either).


*/

let = myFriendsList = ["Jon", "Bran", "Rickon", "Rob", "Sansa", "Arya"]; //length is 6

Pop, Push, Shift, Unshift

Picture the Array as a stack of Lego bricks. Element zero was the first one added and it sits at the bottom of the stack. The element on top was the last one added. The pop method will remove an element from the top. The push method will add a new element on the top.

The crude analogy used to remember the other two methods is - taking a shift will drop an element off the bottom of the stack and unshift will reverse that.

*/
let removed1 = myFriendsList.pop(); // remove the last element added
let removed2 = myFriendsList.shift(); //remove the first element from the array

myFriendsList.unshift(removed2); //put removed2 back at the start of the array
myFriendsList.push(); // put removed back as the last element

//You can call these methods repeatedly to remove everything from the Array, if you want.

/* 
Array at method
A new method has been added recently for Arrays in JavaScript.

We already know that we can use the square brackets to target a specific element in an array. Inside the square brackets you put the index position of the element you want to access. Remember to start counting at zero

/* 
Slice and Splice
If you want to remove one or more elements from the middle of an Array you can use the slice method. If you want to add one or more elements to the middle of an Array you can use the splice method.

The slice method needs a starting index and an ending point. The starting index is a number for the position of the first element to remove. The second number provided is the index to stop before. If negative numbers are used for either value then count from the end of the Array. If no ending number is provided then it will remove from the starting position to the end of the Array. The slice method does NOT change the original array. It returns a copy of the selected items.

The splice method can be used to only insert new elements or to remove elements and replace them with a new series of elements. It takes a starting position as the first argument. The second argument is how many elements to remove, which may be zero. The third and all subsequent arguments will be inserted at the starting index. The splice method will change the original array.


*/

let numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
let students = ["alice", "bob", "charlie", "diana"];
let firstnum = 2;
let lastnum = 4;

let removednumbs = numbers.splice(firstnum, lastnum);
console.log(numbers);

let removeStudents = students.slice(firstnum, lastnum);
console.log(removeStudents);

/* 
ForEach Method
Once you understand what arrays are and how you can add and remove values from an Array, then you need to know how to loop over the values. We already discussed the for...loop and for...in statements last week, and that works fine but there are actually built-in methods designed to loop over Arrays for specific purposes.

If you want to loop through an array, there is a built-in method for doing so, called forEach. The method has one required parameter - a function. It will call this function once for each item in the Array.

When it calls the function, it will pass three things to the function.

The item from the Array
The index number of the current item.
A copy of the Array which can be used to do comparisons.
The three items will ALWAYS come in that order. You can name the three variables whatever you like.


*/

let beers = ["corona", "goose island", "boneshaker"];
beers.forEach(function (item, index, arr) {
  console.log(index, item);
});

/* 

Array Map
The map method works similarly to the forEach method. It loops once for each item in the Array. It calls a function (which you provide) each time it loops. It provides the same three values to the function each time it is called.

The difference is that while the forEach method returns undefined, the map method returns a NEW array built out of the return values from the function it called.

Because it called the function once for each item in the Array, it means that the new Array will always be the exact same length as the original array.


*/

let cheeses = ["Gouda", "cheddar", "Brie"];
let tasteGoodWithCheese = cheeses.map((cheese) => `${cheese} is tasty`);

console.log(tasteGoodWithCheese);

  "MechaZ",
  "NanoTron",
  "Circuitra",
  "DigiDroid",
  "AutoMech",
  "VoltBot",
];

/* 

Array Filter
Just like the forEach method and the map method, the Array filter method will loop through an array and call a function once for each element in the array. The filter method also returns a NEW array.

However, the difference between the map and filter methods is that the filter method returns an array holding a copy of the original array elements, and it is allowed to include or exclude elements from the original array as it loops.

If the function called by the filter method returns a falsey value then it excludes the current element. If it returns a truthy value then it will include that element in the new array.

*/

let filterBots = robotNames.map((robot) => robot.length > 6);

console.log(filterBots);

/* 

Sorting Arrays
At some point you will want to sort an Array. Thankfully, the JavaScript array object comes with a built-in sort method. The sort method will change the original Array.

The sort will sort the items in the Array in alphabetical order.


*/

let hotels = ["zoo-hotel", "beach-side", "mountain welcome", "sleepy-bog"];
hotels.sort();
console.log(hotels);

/* 

Other Array Methods
There are MANY array methods that are used routinely. Do not try to memorize them all. Get familiar with what the possibilities are. You will gain expertise in the methods over time, with practice. Revisit this list on a regular basis to review.

One thing to pay special attention to with Array methods is whether the method changes the original Array or whether it creates a new one. If the method changes the original Array then it is called a destructive method.


Array.concat( )
The Array concat method allows you to add another Array on to the end of the original one. It returns a new Array.

*/

let arr1 = [1, 20, 5];
let arr2 = [25, 50, 75];
let arr3 = arr1.concat(arr2);

let arr4 = arr1 + arr2;

console.log(arr3 + arr4);

/* 

Array.includes( )
The Array includes method will loop through an Array looking for a match for the value that you provide. The value you provide can be any Primitive. Optionally you can add a starting position to begin looping. It returns a true or false value.


*/

let fieldOps = ["bob", "agent-47", "mouse"];

let get47 = fieldOps.includes("agent-47");

console.log(get47);

/* 

Array.some( )
The Array some method will loop through the values in an Array and returns true as soon as it finds the first value that meets your condition. It accepts a function as it's parameter. This makes it very efficient because it could exit before looping through all values.

*/

let planets = ["earth", "mars", "saturn", "jupiter"];

planets.some((x) => {
  // console.log(`Huston we found ${x}`);
  return x == "mars";
});

/*Array.every( )
The Array every method will check every value in an Array to see if they all meet a condition that you choose. It returns a true or false.
*/

let anotherNumnerList = [100, 350, 750, 234, 6];

let getEvenNumbers = anotherNumnerList.every((even) => {
  if (even % 2 === 1) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
});

/* 
Array.join( )
The Array join method will convert all the values in the Array into Strings and then combine all the Strings into a single String. You have the option of putting a separator between each of the String values as their are joined.

*/

let songsOfDeath = [
  "I",
  "love",
  "the",
  "smell",
  "of",
  "napalm",
  "in",
  "the",
  "morning",

/* 

Array.reduce( )
The Array reduce method will loop through an Array and return a single value. You provide a function and a starting value for comparison. The starting value is often called the accumulator.

*/

let accum = [10, -5, 15];

let reduceAccum = accum.reduce((acc, num) => {

/* 
Prototypes:
Every type of Object has a prototype. A prototype is a special kind of an object that contains all the methods that will be shared by all Objects of that type.

JavaScript has something called the prototype chain, which is how inheritance works in JavaScript. Each one of the Object prototypes will have a connection to the prototype object belonging to it's parent object. At the top of the chain is the prototype of the Object object.

As an example, look at the toString() method. When you create an Array (opens new window), there is no method in Array called valueof. However, you can write the following and no error occurs.

*/

/* 
Square Brackets vs Dot Notation:

The first way we access any property or method in an object is with dot notation. That means putting a period between each object name and property name.


*/

let vehicle = {
  make: "BMW",
  year: 2014,

let objBubba = {
  name: "Bubba",
  age: 44,
};

objBubba["name"];
objBubba["age"];

console.log(objBubba["name"]);

/* 

Note the quotation marks around the property names. All Object property names (for our purposes) will be Strings.

So, why the two approaches? - With the square brackets we can put a variable inside the brackets instead of a string

*/

let n = "name";
let ag = "age";

objBubba[n]; // has the value 'Bubba'
objBubba[ag]; // has the value 44

//obj.n; // this would fail because JS would look for obj.n or obj['n']
//obj.ag; // this would fail because JS would look for obj.a or obj['a

/* 

As a best practice, when you are going to change an object by updating the value of a property, deleting a property, or adding a new property, then you should check to see if that property already exists.

There are two ways that we can check for the existence of a property on any object. We can use the in operator or the hasOwnProperty() method. The in operator is the simplest and shortest to write.
